# ✅ Test Case Management System (Java Console App)

A lightweight, beginner-friendly Java console application to manage test cases efficiently — built from the perspective of an automation tester learning and applying core Java concepts.

## 💡 About the Project

This project simulates a basic Test Case Management System in Java, allowing users to:

- Add new test cases
- View all test cases
- Execute (mark as Passed/Failed)
- Delete test cases
- Restore deleted test cases

It’s a great starting point for QA engineers and Java learners who want to build logic-driven tools from scratch.
