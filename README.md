This is a beginner-friendly Java console application that simulates a Test Case Management System, designed for QA engineers and Java learners. It allows users to add, view, execute (mark as passed/failed), delete, and restore test cases through a command-line interface, demonstrating core Java concepts like OOP and exception handling. Built from an automation tester's perspective, it provides hands-on practice with Java fundamentals while simulating real-world testing workflows without requiring external tools.
